# brewery-locator

This project has been deployed using surge at -----> http://the-tale-of-brew-cities.surge.sh/ <------


This is the first project we worked on at my bootcamp.  

My partner and I spent 1 week of class developing this app and pushed to his github account so I decided to make my own repo and store it in there as well.

We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript which at the time was all we new.

The app uses two separate APIs and returns a map of a queried city with pins of breweries in that city that you can choose to favorite.

The favorites are stored in local storage and can also be removed.
